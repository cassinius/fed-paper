	abstract = {The grand goal of Machine Learning is to develop software which can learn from previous experience—similar to how we humans do. Ultimately, to reach a level of usable intelligence, we need
	(1) to learn from prior data, (2) to extract knowledge, (3) to generalize—i.e., guessing where probability function mass/density concentrates, (4) to fight the curse of dimensionality, and (5) to disentangle underlying explanatory factors of the data—i.e., to make sense of the data in the context of an application domain. To address these challenges and to ensure successful machine learning applications in various domains an integrated machine learning approach is important. 
	This requires a concerted international effort without boundaries, supporting collaborative, cross-domain, interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary work of experts from seven sections, ranging from data pre-processing to data visualization, i.e., to map results found in arbitrarily high dimensional spaces into the lower dimensions to make it accessible, usable and useful to the end user. An integrated machine learning approach needs also to consider issues of privacy, data protection, safety, security, user acceptance and social implications. 
	This paper is the inaugural introduction to the new journal of MAchine Learning & Knowledge Extraction (MAKE). The goal is to provide an incomplete, personally biased, but consistent introduction into the concepts of MAKE and a brief overview of some selected topics to stimulate future research in the international research community.}

Automatic approaches greatly benefit from the availability of "big data". However, sometimes, for example in health informatics, we are confronted not a small number of data sets or rare events, and with complex problems where aML-approaches fail or deliver unsatisfactory results. Here, interactive Machine Learning (iML) may be of help and the "human-in-the-loop" approach may be beneficial in solving computationally hard problems, where human expertise can help to reduce an exponential search space through heuristics. <br/>In this paper, experiments are discussed which help to evaluate the effectiveness of the iML-"human-in-the-loop" approach, particularly in opening the "black box", thereby enabling a human to directly and indirectly manipulating and interacting with an algorithm. For this purpose, we selected the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) framework, and use it on the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) which is of high importance in solving many practical problems in health informatics, e.g. in the study of proteins.}

	abstract = {Machine learning (ML) is the fastest growing field in computer science, and health informatics is amongst the greatest challenges. The goal of ML is to develop algorithms which can learn and improve over time and can be used for predictions. Most ML researchers concentrate on automatic Machine Learning (aML), where great advances have been made, for example, in speech recognition, recommender systems, or autonomous vehicles. Automatic approaches greatly benefit from big data with many training sets. However, in the health domain, sometimes we are confronted with a small number of data sets or rare events, where aML-approaches suffer of insufficient training samples. Here interactive Machine Learning (iML) may be of help, having its roots in Reinforcement Learning (RL), Preference Learning (PL) and Active Learning (AL). The term iML is not yet well used, so we define it as algorithms that can interact with agents and can optimize their learning behaviour through these interactions, where the agents can also be human. This human-in-the-loop can be beneficial in solving computationally hard problems, e.g., subspace clustering, protein folding, or k-anonymization of health data, where human expertise can help to reduce an exponential search space through heuristic selection of samples. Therefore, what would otherwise be an NP-hard problem, reduces greatly in complexity through the input and the assistance of a human agent involved in the learning phase.},

	journal = {Brain Informatics},

	abstract = {The “doctor in the loop” is a new paradigm in information-driven medicine, picturing the doctor as authority inside a loop supplying an expert system with information on actual patients, treatment results, and possible additional (side-)effects, including general information in order to enhance data-driven medical science, as well as giving back treatment advice to the doctor himself. While this approach can be very beneficial for new medical approaches like P4 medicine (personal, predictive, preventive, and participatory), it also relies heavily on the authenticity of the data and thus increases the need for secure and reliable databases. In this paper, we propose a solution in order to protect the doctor in the loop against responsibility derived from manipulated data, thus enabling this new paradigm to gain acceptance in the medical community. This work is an extension of the conference paper Kieseberg et al. (Brain Informatics and Health, 2015), which includes extensions to the original concept.},
