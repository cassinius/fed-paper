\begin{abstract}
	
With Google's \textit{Federated Learning} \& Facebook's introduction of client-side NLP into their chat service, the era of client-side Machine Learning has finally begun. While interesting ML approaches beyond the realm of toy examples were hitherto confined to large data-centers and powerful GPU's, exponential trends in technology and the introduction of billions of smartphones bring sophisticated processing pipelines within reach of even hand-held devices. Such approaches hold several promises: 1. Without the need for powerful server infrastructures, even small companies could be scalable to millions of users easily and cost-efficiently; 2. Since data only used in the learning process never need to leave the client, personal information can be used free of privacy and data security concerns; 3. Since privacy is preserved automatically, the full range of personal information on the client device can be utilized for learning; and 4. without round-trips to the server, results like recommendations can be made available to the user much faster, resulting in enhanced user experience. In this paper we propose an architecture for federated learning from personalized, graph based recommendations computed on client devices, collectively enhancing a global knowledge graph. In this network, individual users would 'train' their local recommender engines, while a server-based voting mechanism averages the emerging client-side models, preventing over-fitting on highly personal data.

% \emph{SaNGreeA} is the abbreviation for Social Network Greedy Anonymization, which describes an anonymization algorithm which takes into account information loss as well as structural loss (from anonymizing the neighborhood of a network node). It is said to be greedy as it uses greedy clustering under the hood in order to avoid having to sift through an exponential solution space to find an optimum.
